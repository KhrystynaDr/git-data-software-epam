You think that I can't live without your love?
you'll see
You think I can't go on another day?
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side?
You'll see, somehow, someway
You think that I can never laugh again?
you'll see
You think that you've destroyed my faith in love?
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home?
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see
You think that you are strong? But you are weak
you'll see
It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat
I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, someday
All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see
